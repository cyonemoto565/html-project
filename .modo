<h1>How to Play Water Polo</h1>
<h2>Summary of the game</h2>
<p>Waterpolo is an exhilarating sport, which requires the use of the whole body making it a very physically intensive sport.<br />
The goal of the game is simple, you have a pool with a goal on each side. The aim of the game is to get a ball into the goal.<br />
However, there are key rules that need to be addressed. First is that you can only use one hand to do anything,<br />
meaning that you can not pick the ball up with two hands, you can block the ball with two hands (unless it is the goalie)</p>
